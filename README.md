Fest Buddy is a matching algorithm which is designed for Middle East Technical University students.
Fest Buddy is designed for Middle East Technical University students who follows @odtudeepdarkhub instagram page. 

This program finds `the one` who you would like to go to Spring Fest. 

This is part of my dream project. Questions are important. This is first version of this project.

Data is collected by google forms. 

If there is a match, you are going to get a mail by your METU Mail address.
